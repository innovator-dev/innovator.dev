        <h1>Tenants associations management platform</h1>
        <h2><span data-icon="&#xe90e;"></span> Business requirements</h2>
        <p>Months ago, we got a challenge to <strong>digitalize</strong> a group of tenants associations counting more than 10.000 customers. The <strong>business requirement</strong> has been to build a product where tenants or homeowners could check their monthly receipts and pay their expenses (utilities, rents) online in a secured way.</p>
        <h2><span data-icon="&#xe91e;"></span> Technical solution</h2>
        <p>With such a high number of customers, we went for a custom solution with an easy and secured on-boarding process. On the platform, customers could see data on their monthly consumption and receipts, submit meter reading data and pay due amounts online.</p>
        <h3>Feature highlights</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>secured account creation with cross-validation</li>
          <li>integration with payment processor to allow online payments</li>
          <li>capability to submit meter reading based on dynamic rules</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><span data-icon="&#xe928;"></span> Time to market</h2>
        <p>Released to customers in about <strong>one and a half months</strong> from collaboration kickoff, first phase of the platform included the capability to view monthly expenses and pay due amounts.</p>
        <p>After a round of feedback gathering, we delivered the second phase of the platform with the ability for customers to submit their meter readings and split their due amounts in separate payments.</p>
        <h2><span data-icon="&#xe907;"></span> Feedback from our customer</h2>
        <p>"Proof of a professionalism and a communication ability that we have rarely seen and as proof today our platform is active, it is visited and used by thousands of clients who pay and use the information with great ease. We emphasize that for the image of our company, the implementation of this platform propelled us to the top of the hierarchy and added value to our work."</p>
